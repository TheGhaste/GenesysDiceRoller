# GenesysRPG
Character Sheet for Roll20 for the Fantasy Flight Games Genesys Role Playing Game

NOTE: The Dice Suggestions feature is not working as intended, recommended to turn this off as leaving this feature on could cause unintended side effects while the skills are being updated to Genesys skill names.
